OMD is a multibody dynamics application used to simulate mechanical systems. Unlike most multibody dynamics applications, OMD was built to accommodate different approaches to solving such problems. There is a frame work to define rigid bodies, joints, forces, integrators and three different models which use different techniques to solve the equations of motion for a set of bodies, joints and forces
